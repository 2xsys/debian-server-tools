## Preventing machine and human errors while running your web application

[:hungary: Magyar verzi√≥](/CV2.md)

DevOps can be seen as the foundation of my work,
which focuses on **proactive** maintenance of web-based systems.
This&nbsp;includes comprehensive understanding of the application,
full source code life cycle management, continuous integration (CI) and automated deployment (CD).

As a team member my exclusive focus is on **non-userfacing** parts:
sustainability, stability, vulnerability, performance of the application.

### Proactive maintenance features

- You benefit from all incidents at all my clients (ever)
- I maintain a blacklist and a list of recommendations
  of technologies, software and business procedures
- You receive documentation on project procedures
- Many types of alerts and continuous log analysis

### How to build infrastructure?

We have to start planning (and error prevention)
from _the bulldozer leveling the ground for the datacenter_
and build infrastructure **and** the application from there up to browser rendering.

- Choose **specialized** domain registrar, dns, ssl, cdn, email, backup providers
- Choose an honest, proactive and technically advanced cloud provider:
  virtualization, network, storage, processor, memory
- Modern and small operating system
- Modern server software: webserver, fast SSL, database, in-memory cache, PHP environment
- Network and application security
- Deep monitoring of **everything** we have and depend on
